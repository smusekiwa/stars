            <p>As the name suggests, astrology is the study of stars. Despite being viewed as mediaeval superstition, it continues to fascinate the human mind. In fact, its trend is rising. There is a very little part of astrology that most people are familiar with, especially the twelve sign zodiac and how it relates to personality and divination. Literally meaning "circle of animals," the Zodiac (or Zodiac belt) is the "belt" made up of the twelve zodiac signs: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.Â  The idea of a zodiac is quite ancient. You can use a telescope to locate your star.</p>
